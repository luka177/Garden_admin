This is garrden administaration system (at least i will use it as that). For now you can create new table (File-->New) it will ask for size of table, maxsimum 
is  5000x5000. Then you can see table in maind window, if you put your pointer on some cell in table it will be highlited with red. When you click that cell 
you will see new small window there you can choose image from list for now you will see "pyimagenumber" later will fix, you will see that image in window, you 
can enter "Name" in that window (just some text), you will see that name in main window when youre pointer is on cell. You can Save (File-->Save as) then you 
will see file dialog where you will choose file location and name. Of course you can load with (File-->load). You can change sizes of cells with 
(File-->Set cell size) you will be promted for new size in new dialog.
For now thats all.
